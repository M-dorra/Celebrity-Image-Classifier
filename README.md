# 🧑‍🎤 Celebrity Image Classifier

A machine learning project that classifies celebrity images using traditional computer vision and machine learning techniques. The project handles everything from data cleaning and feature engineering to model selection and deployment via a Flask API and browser UI.

## 📂 Project Highlights

- ✅ Face & eye detection with Haar cascades using OpenCV  
- 📈 Wavelet Transform used for feature enhancement  
- 🤖 Trained with SVM, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest  
- 🔎 GridSearchCV for model tuning  
- 🌍 Deployed via Flask API with a responsive HTML/CSS/JS frontend  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python 3.x**
- **NumPy**, **OpenCV** for data preprocessing
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, **Pandas** for visualization
- **Scikit-learn** for model training and evaluation
- **Flask** for web API
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** for the user interface

## 🚀 Running the App Locally

1. Install dependencies
2. Run the Flask server
